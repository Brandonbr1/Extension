Pelanggaran hak cipta adalah situasi sehari hari bagi para pembuat modifikasi. Sebagian besar modifikasi yang agak populer saat ini pada titik tertentu telah disalin dan didistribusikan kembali secara ilegal ke situs pihak ketiga, tanpa pengakuan atau izin dari pengembangnya. Banyak dari situs web ini dihosting di Vietnam atau Rusia, dan sulit untuk dihapus karena undang-undang hak cipta yang berbeda. Many of these sites illegally monetize their download links to earn money off of the modders' hard work, and several even go as far as to claim ownership of the illegal content. Some of them are known to host malware and viruses and claim that these are real, harmless mods. Ini harus dihentikan.

When DMCAs and take-down notices fail, we have to rely on the community to stop people from downloading mods from these sources. However, many of the websites engaging in the type of activity outlined above look very well designed and official, confusing many players and making them believe that these sites are actually the real ones. As a result, many machines are infected with viruses and malware, modders lose revenue and reputation and are spammed with reports about bugs which have already been fixed in newer versions of their mods, since only the old versions are hosted on the illegal sites. Stop Mod Reposts is designed to stop this. Here's how we plan to do it:

- Letting people know that the sites are illegal. There is no way we can stop people from using these sites when they're unaware that the actions of the host is against the law and that the host is ignorant of the modders' rights. Therefore, this extension will display an overlay when browsing a site like this.
- Letting people know that visiting these sites puts their computers at risk. No one wants to be infected with malware, so we'll warn them that the sites potentially can harm their machines.

The sites this extension warns about are the same sites as are listed on https://github.com/StopModReposts/Illegal-Mod-Sites and is updated every few days or hours with new hosts.
